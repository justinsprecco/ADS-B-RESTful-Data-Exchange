# ADS-B RESTful Data Exchange - Broker

The Broker Service serves as the central communication in the data exchange, responsible for aggregating, processing, and distributing flight data from various ground stations. It connects with the Transponder Middleware and the MongoDB Database to provide live and historical flight information to subscribing clients. It will also listen for alerts from the Fuzzy Service for significant events.
